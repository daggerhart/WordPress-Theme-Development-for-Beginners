## How Templates Work

WordPress decides what template to use by the context of the webpage a user is viewing.  For example when viewing a Page, WordPress will first look for a very specifically named template for the Page being viewed, then it will fallback to less specific template name until it finds the best match.

This can be a bit daunting at first, but luckily there is a lot of great information out there about this. The process of WordPress deciding what template to use is called the **[Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/ "Template Hierarchy")**.

### Example: How Files Are Loaded

Let's see how our Awesomesauce theme files work.

If we were to view an individual Post on the website, the theme files would load in the following order.

1. **single.php** - Determined by WordPress to be the best match for the webpage being viewed.
1. **header.php** - Loaded by single.php with the `get_header();` function.
1. **template-parts/content-single.php** - Loaded by single.php with the `get_template_part();` function.
1. **sidebar.php** - Loaded by single.php with the `get_sidebar();` function.
1. **footer.php** - Loaded by single.php with the `get_footer();` function.
