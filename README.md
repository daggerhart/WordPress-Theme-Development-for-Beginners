# WordPress Theme Development for Beginners

Let's be honest, this guide is for beginners who are ready to jump into the deep end of best practices.

## Project Plan

This document aims to get new WordPress developers up to speed by providing straight forward instructions for creating a theme using modern tools and workflow.  By following along with this document you will end up with a local development environment, and a custom WordPress theme that uses SASS and lives within a git repo.

### Development Software

* **VirtualBox** - Virtualization software for running other operating systems within your computer.  This allows us have a full version of linux within our computers that better matches how a live web server works.
* **Vagrant** - A tool for provisioning (creating) virtual machines.
* **VVV** - A pre-built, community-supported Vagrant configuration for WordPress development.
* **Git** - Version control system for managing code during development.  Easily allows for tracking changes, and merging new code into an existing project.
* **SourceTree** - A GUI available on Windows and Mac for managing Git projects.  This makes Git much easier to use, as we won't have to learn the command line interface.
* **GitHub.com** - A website that provides free Git repositories for both open source and private projects.
* **SASS** - A CSS pre-processing implementation that allows us to write much less CSS for a project. This basically makes CSS into a simple programming language. We will be using the SCSS flavor (supported by the SASS team), because it looks more like regular CSS.
 
### WordPress Theme Build

* **_s** - (Underscores) is a very simple WordPress starter-theme. Perfect for creating a brand new theme from scratch as it is completely unopinionated in its structure, and adheres to WordPress best practices out of the box.
* **Bootstrap** - A CSS framework for easily making great responsive websites.
