## Creating Themes with Underscores

To start, let's make a very simple Underscores theme that does not use SASS. This will allow us to gain a better understanding of WordPress themes in general before getting involved with the other tools.

### My First Underscores Theme

For this example, we're going to create a theme named "Awesomesauce".

1. Visit Underscores' website http://underscores.me/ and find the text box named "Theme Name" next to a button named "Generate".
1. In the Theme Name box, type `Awesomesauce`, then click Generate. This will download your newly generated theme as a zip file.
1. Extract the zip file to your desktop for now.

We have created a new theme!  Next, let's take a step back and explore the VVV and WordPress files a bit, so we know where to put our new theme.

### Exploring VVV

* Using your computer's file manager (Explorer / Finder), browse to where you extracted VVV.
* In the VVV folder, you'll see about a dozen files and folders. The only one we'll ever worry about is `www`. Open the `www` folder.
* Now in `VVV\www` we have another few folders. For this series the only one we're going to work with is `wordpress-default`. Open the `wordpress-default` folder.
* This is the folder we're going to work in: `VVV\www\wordpress-default`.

Next, let's take a quick look at the WordPress file structure.

### Exploring WordPress

* In the root of the WordPress folder there are 3 main directories, and about a dozen files.
* The only file we'll ever worry about here is `wp-config.php`. But, since VVV set this up for us, we can ignore it all for now.
* The only folder we'll concern ourselves with is the `wp-content` folder. This folder is where WordPress keeps plugins, themes, and file uploads. Go into the `wp-content` folder.
* Go into the `themes` folder.
* Now you should be at: `VVV\www\wordpress-default\wp-content\themes`. This is where we will put our newly generated theme.

### Installing Your New Theme

* Copy your newly extracted theme named `awesomesauce` into this folder, so that the `index.php` file for your theme can be found at this path: `VVV\www\wordpress-default\wp-content\themes\awesomesauce\index.php`
* Login to WordPress at http://local.wordpress.dev/wp-login.php with the credentials `admin` and `password`.
* In the dashboard visit Appearance, and you should see the Awesomesauce theme. Activate it.
 
You now have a working WordPress theme! No one said it was going to be pretty. In fact, quite the opposite. This is a completely blank theme, so it should have practically no style at all.

Spend some time exploring the theme files a little bit. Specifically, open `style.css` and look at the comments at the very top.  These comments control the information about the theme itself. 

```
/*
Theme Name: Awesomesauce
Theme URI: http://underscores.me/
Author: Underscores.me
Author URI: http://underscores.me/
Description: Description
```

If you change the Theme Name or Description here, it will change the name in the WordPress Appearance section.
